Problem 05_02_Positions Of
Write a program that reads a matrix of integers from the console, then a number, and prints all the positions at which that number 
appears in the matrix.
The matrix definition on the console will contain a line with two positive integer numbers R and C – the number of rows and columns 
in the matrix – followed by R lines, each containing C numbers (separated by spaces), representing each row of the matrix.
The number you will need to find the positions of will be entered on a single line, after the matrix.
You should print each position on a single line – first print the row, then the column at which the number appears.
If the number does not appear in the matrix, print not found
